A <b>shepherd</b> boy in village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</P>

<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "wolf! Wolf! The Wolf is carrying
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came runnign for help but 
didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied,"It was just fun.There is no wolf here". <strong>The boy 
played a similar trick repeatly for many days.</strong>
</p>

<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly,
suddenly, a wolf came out of nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.

lamb away!"</strike>
